  caption: A moving cart attached to a wall by a spring and a dashpot. The equations
    of motion for every 1-degree-of-freedom system can be linearized around the equilibrium
    points to the second order differential equation that describes this system. Thus,
    understanding the free response and selected forced responses for this system
    can give deep insight into the stability of the equilibrium points and the behavior
    of a large number of systems. See Lectures 20 and 21 for more information. (Image
